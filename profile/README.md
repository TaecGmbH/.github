## Digitalizing construction sites 🏗️

The German construction process of a building can be defined in two major steps: **Planning** 💡 and **Execution** 🚧.

The **Planning** phase 💡 is fairly digital. Architects and structural engineers create a 3D model of a building they want to build.

## Our mission

The **Execution** phase 🚧 however, is not digital at all. Paperwork is essential, as there is little software to coordinate it with. Specifically the dependencies of most paperwork between each other creates unmanagable complexity.

> For example, a deliverer for concrete of a wall may be late. This means that the ceiling for the wall possibly has to be delayed (Since you can't build a ceiling above a wall that isn't built.)

#### TAEC is the first software product to recognize the needs of construction managers that go beyond using a 3D model from the Planning phase. The first software product to coordinate deliveries in a new way.

## Our standards
### Product standards
To create the very best that our product can be, we require an in-depth co-development process involving construction managers and foremen. This differs a lot from the classic consulting-oriented approach.

Furthermore, we believe that construction software can be user-friendly too. The few existing software for the construction industry is often created by external, "pragmatic" software companies or inexperienced in-house developers.

We recognize that we are an "external software company" as well. Our goal isn't to satisfy one client though, it is to satisfy the industry as a whole. With this goal in mind, we believe that the small benefits of a friendly UI/UX scales so that it amounts to a huge benefit for everyone.
### Software standards
To ensure a rapid development of the quality product we are, a high data standard and in-depth tool setup is essential. This requirement is specifically acknowledged and resources are provided as such. If you are interested in being a part of an elite software development process and extending it to ensure that status, contact us.
